# Recording 3CX CDRs into a PostgreSQL Database with Grafana

## Description

This tool facilitates the recording of 3CX Call Detail Records (CDRs) into a PostgreSQL database and the creation of dashboards using Grafana.

It allows you to collect call data from your 3CX telephony system and store it in a PostgreSQL database. With Grafana, you can then visualize this data in the form of interactive and customizable dashboards.

## Key Features

- **CDR Collection**: Retrieves CDRs from 3CX via various transfer modes (TCP, FTP, SFTP, SCP).
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Stores CDRs in a PostgreSQL database for centralized and structured storage.
- **Web API**: A Web API is provided to interact with the stored CDR data.
- **Grafana Visualization**: Creates Grafana dashboards to visualize and analyze call data interactively.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- FastAPI (Web API)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Grafana (Data Visualization)
- Docker (Containerization)
